#Vortex Video

Vortex Video is a project designed to create an online accessible Content Management System with Content Delivery 
(CMS/CD)in order to provide an open web application for the development and testing of software designed to work
with similar but less open systems. This is an application written primarily in PHP which provides video streaming
with the CMS seperate from the CD for programmers to have a system for testing and designing software which 
interacts with and requires a CMS, CD, or video streaming application for development.
